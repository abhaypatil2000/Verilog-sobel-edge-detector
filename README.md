On fpga4students you would get a code which only simulates and here I have a code which also implements and can be burned on a fpga board
check the height and width of the image.
check the bmp header format. it depends on the height and the width of the input image
first convert .bmp file to .hex file and remove the first 54 numbers from the hex file, take that path and put it in infile value in the code.
